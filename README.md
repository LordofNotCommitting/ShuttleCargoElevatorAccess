Tired of carrying your loot from 4th floor to the shuttle? This mod enables shuttle cargo access from the elevator.

I do however suck at making buttons so I linked this feature to existing button that is rarely used - the Red [x] "close elevator UI" button. (see picture in /media/description.png)

Clicking that button will access shuttle cargo.
