Tired of carrying your loot from 4th floor to the shuttle? This mod enables shuttle cargo access from the elevator.
**You need Magnum shuttle upgrade to make this function work. Otherwise button will not appear.**

Thank to Edair0 (https://github.com/Edair0) for creating button function that is interactable.

Changelog:

v1.21

Less savage way of checking if button should be active or not.

v1.2

Now button is does not appear if you do not have Magnum Shuttle Upgrade.

v1.1

Edair0 created cargo button to interact with.
Now cargo button will be inaccessible if you do not have the ship upgrade. (it was previously)

Clicking that button will access shuttle cargo.
