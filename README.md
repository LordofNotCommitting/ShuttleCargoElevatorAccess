Tired of carrying your loot from 4th floor to the shuttle? This mod enables shuttle cargo access from the elevator.

Thank to Edair0 (https://github.com/Edair0) for creating button function that is interactable.

Changelog:

v1.1

Edair0 created cargo button to interact with.

Now cargo button will be inaccessible if you do not have the ship upgrade. (it was previously)

Clicking that button will access shuttle cargo.
